# React Starter

## Requirements

- Node ^13.12.0
- Yarn ^1.22.4

## Getting Started

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project containing the following environment variables:

        PORT=8080

2.  Install the project dependencies

        yarn

3.  Start the development server

        yarn start

## Testing

### Visual Unit Testing

Visual unit testing is done with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).

To start Storybook, run

    yarn storybook

### Unit Testing / End-To-End Testing

Both unit testing and end-to-end testing are done with [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

To start Jest in interactive mode, run

    yarn test

Unit and end-to-end tests can be one in the same by utilizing the `mockData` function found in `utils/test`.

This is because the `mockData` function ignores mocks when the `CONTEXT` environment variable is set to `e2e` like so:

    CONTEXT=e2e
